# My First Full Stack App using mongoDB
In this project I practice Creating an Express Server.This app allows me to save and read from MongoDB, using the template engine Embedded JS.

**Link to project:** Coming Soon

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Improvements to Be Made:

In the future I would add a stylesheet to this app, since it was a demo run of my newly learned mongoDB I have left it as is.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned to execute CREATE and READ operations, save, and read from MongoDB.
As well as how to use a template engine like Embedded JS to render HTML values entered in the form field.
